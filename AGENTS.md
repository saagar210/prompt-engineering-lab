## Definition of Done (Git + Performance)
- Work on non-default branch only.
- Branch must match `codex/<type>/<slug>`.
- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits.
- Commits must be atomic by concern.
- Run reviewer/fixer loop before final completion:
  - `reviewer-findings-v1`
  - `fixer-apply-findings-v1`
  - re-run reviewer until no P0/P1 remain
- PR must include sections: What, Why, How, Testing, Performance impact, Risk / Notes.
- If lockfile changed, include lockfile rationale in PR body.
- Required checks before done-state:
  - git hygiene
  - bundle delta
  - build delta
  - performance budgets (profile-dependent)
  - assets/memory checks
- Required gates block completion when `fail` or `not-run`.

## Verification Contract
- Canonical commands are in `.codex/verify.commands`.
- Use `.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh` for deterministic execution.
